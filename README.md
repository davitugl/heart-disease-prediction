## About Project
This project aims to predict the presence of **heart disease** using a clinical dataset. Given the medical nature of the problem, the primary goal was to maximize **Recall**, ensuring that as few sick patients as possible are missed (minimizing False Negatives). Through rigorous testing of multiple models, **Logistic Regression** was identified as the champion due to its stability on small datasets and linear interpretability.
